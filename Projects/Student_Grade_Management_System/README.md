# Student Grade Management System

## Concepts Covered
- Encapsulation (private attributes with `__`)
- Getters & Setters (`@property`)
- Data Validation
- Class Interaction

## Project Description

This project implements a Student Grade Management System to practice encapsulation, property decorators, and data validation in Python. The system focuses on safe handling and validation of student data, specifically grades.

### Features

- **Student Class**
  - **Private Attributes:**
    - `__name` (Student's name)
    - `__roll_number` (Student's roll number)
    - `__grade` (Student's grade)
  - **Getter & Setter Methods:**
    - Use `@property` and setter to safely access and update the grade
    - Grade value is validated to be between 0 and 100
  - **Pass/Fail Check:**
    - Method to check whether the student passed or failed based on their grade

- **Demo**
  - Create and display multiple student objects
  - Demonstrate safe data access and validation

### What You'll Learn

- How to use private attributes for encapsulation
- How to implement property-based getters and setters in Python
- How to validate data within setter methods
- How classes can interact to manage multiple objects

---

Use this project as a practice ground for robust data handling and encapsulation in Python classes, or as a base for more advanced student management systems!
