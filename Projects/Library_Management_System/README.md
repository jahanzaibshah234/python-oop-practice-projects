# Library Management System (Intermediate OOP Project)

## Concepts Covered
- Multiple Classes
- Composition (object inside object)
- Basic Relationships

## Project Description

This project is a simple Library Management System designed for intermediate learners to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. Key topics include class composition and modeling relationships between objects.

### Features

- **Book Class**
  - Attributes:
    - `title` (Book title)
    - `author` (Book author)
    - `isbn` (Book ISBN number)
    - `available` (Boolean: Is the book available for borrowing?)

- **Library Class**
  - Manages a collection of `Book` objects
  - Methods to:
    - Add new books to the collection
    - Display all books in the library
    - Borrow a book (mark as unavailable)
    - Return a book (mark as available)

- **Multiple Book Objects**
  - Create multiple books and manage them through the Library class

### What You'll Learn

- How to design and use multiple classes in Python
- How to implement composition (object inside object)
- How to model basic relationships between objects (Library and Books)
- How to manage collections of objects and their states

---

This project is ideal for those looking to strengthen their understanding of OOP principles and relationships between classes. Use it as a learning template or extend its features for more complex library management needs!
