# Python OOP Practice & Projects

This repository contains my practice problems and projects while learning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python**.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- `problems/` â†’ Small OOP problems for practice.
- `projects/` â†’ Larger projects built using OOP concepts.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
Clone the repo and run a file:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jahanzaibshah234/python-oop-practice-projects.git
cd python-oop-practice-projects/projects/Library_Management_System.py
```

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered in OOP

This repository covers all major topics of Object-Oriented Programming in Python, including:

- **Classes & Objects**: Creating blueprints (classes) and their instances (objects).
- **Attributes & Methods**: Defining properties and behaviors for objects.
- **Encapsulation**: Restricting direct access to data and methods, using public, protected, and private members.
- **Inheritance**: Reusing code by deriving new classes from existing ones.
- **Polymorphism**: Using a unified interface for different data types (method overriding, operator overloading).
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features.
- **Class Variables & Instance Variables**: Understanding scope and sharing of data across objects.
- **Static Methods & Class Methods**: Defining methods bound to class rather than instance.
- **Magic/Dunder Methods**: Customizing built-in behaviour (like `__str__`, `__repr__`, etc.).
- **Composition & Aggregation**: Building complex objects by combining simpler ones.
- **Multiple Inheritance**: Inheriting from more than one base class.
- **Object Lifecycle & Garbage Collection**: Understanding creation, usage, and deletion of objects.
- **Type Hinting & Dataclasses**: Improving code readability and maintainability.
